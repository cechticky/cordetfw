 * Definition of the InStream component.
 *
 * An InStream is responsible for managing the collection of packets (representing
 * incoming reports or incoming commands) from a certain packet source.
 * An InStream is implemented by the InStream State Machine (see figures below)
 * embedded within state CONFIGURED of a Base State Machine.
 *
 * The InStream State Machine has two states. State PCKT_AVAIL represents a situation
 * where one or more packets have been collected from the middleware and are waiting
 * to be processed by the application.
 * State WAITING represents a situation where no packets are pending in the InStream.
 * The packets in the InStream are stored in a <i>Packet Queue</i>.
 *
 * An application can instantiate several InStream Components.
 * Each InStream instance has an identifier which uniquely identifies it
 * within the set of InStream Components.
 * This identifier is an integer in the range 0 to: <code>#CR_FW_NOF_INSTREAM</code>-1.
 * An application should instantiated one InStream for each source of incoming commands
 * or reports.
 *
 * <b>Mode of Use of an InStream Component</b>
 *
 * The configuration of the InStream components is defined statically in
 * <code>CrFwInStreamUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * An InStream component is created with function <code>::CrFwInStreamMake</code>.
 * After being created, the InStream must be initialized and reset.
 * This is done with functions <code>::CrFwCmpInit</code> and <code>::CrFwCmpReset</code>.
 * Nominally, after being initialized and reset the InStream State Machine should be
 * in state CONFIGURED (this can be checked by verifying that function <code>FwSmGetCurState</code>
 * returns CR_FW_BASE_STATE_CONFIGURED).
 *
 * After it has been configured, an InStream can process two transition commands:
 * - A GetPacket command to retrieve one packet (representing either a command or a report)
 *   from the InStream's Packet Queue. The GetPacket command returns packets in the order in
 *   which they were collected from the middleware.
 *   This command is sent through function <code>::CrFwInStreamGetPckt</code>.
 * - A PacketAvailable command to check whether any packets are available at the middleware
 *   interface and, if they are available, to collect them and store them in the InStream's Packet
 *   Queue. This command is sent with the <code>::CrFwInStreamPcktAvail</code> function.
 * .
