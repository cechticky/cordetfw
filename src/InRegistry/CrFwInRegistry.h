 * Definition of the InRegistry Component.
 *
 * An InRegistry acts as a registry for incoming commands or reports (namely for
 * commands or reports which have been loaded into an InManager).
 * The InRegistry is responsible for keeping track of the state of an incoming
 * command or report.
 *
 * The InRegistry is a singleton component which is implemented as an extension
 * of the Base Component of <code>CrFwBaseCmp.h</code>.
 *
 * The InRegistry maintains a list of the last N commands or reports to have been
 * loaded in an InManager.
 * The InRegistry maintains the state of each such command or report.
 * The command's or report's state in the InRegistry can have one of the following values:
 * - PENDING: the command or report is waiting to be executed
 * - EXECUTING: the command has already been executed but has not yet completed
 *   execution
 * - ABORTED: the command was aborted during execution
 * - TERMINATED: the command or report has completed execution
 * .
 * Note that the states EXECUTING and ABORTED only apply to incoming commands (incoming
 * reports are only executed once and then are terminated).
 *
 * The value of N (the maximum number of items which can be tracked by the InRegistry)
 * is fixed and is an initialization parameter.
 *
 * The InRegistry uses the instance identifier of the incoming command or report
 * as the key through which the command or report state is tracked.
 *
 * <b>Mode of Use of an InRegistry Component</b>
 *
 * The configuration of the InRegistry component is defined statically in
 * <code>CrFwInRegistryUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * The InRegistry component is a "final" component that does not normally need
 * to be extended.
 *
 * An InRegistry component is created with function <code>::CrFwInRegistryMake</code>.
 * After being created, the InRegistry must be initialized and reset.
 * This is done with functions <code>::CrFwCmpInit</code> and <code>::CrFwCmpReset</code>.
 * Nominally, after being initialized and reset the InRegistry State Machine should be
 * in state CONFIGURED (this can be checked by verifying that function <code>FwSmGetCurState</code>
 * returns CR_FW_BASE_STATE_CONFIGURED).
