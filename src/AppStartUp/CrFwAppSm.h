/**

 * @ingroup appSmgroup
 * Definition of Application State Machine.
 * The Application State Machine implements the application start-up behaviour
 * (see figures below).
 *
 * The Application State Machine is a singleton.
 * Initially, after it has been started through function <code>FwSmStart</code>,
 * it is in state START-UP.
 * At entry into this state, the Application Start-Up Procedure is executed.
 * This procedure is an adaptation point for the application (it is defined in
 * <code>CrFwAppShutdownProc.c</code>).
 *
 * Normal operation takes place in state NORMAL.
 * In particular, the services provided by an application to its users are only
 * guaranteed to be available when the application is in state NORMAL and it is
 * only from this state that the application makes use of the services provided by
 * other applications.
 * Thus, in state NORMAL, an application may assume that its service interfaces
 * are all operational.
 *
 * When state NORMAL is entered or exited, a notification is sent to the users
 * of the application services.
 * The content of this notification is an adaptation point.
 *
 * An application can be reset by sending command Reset to its Application State
 * Machine (this is done through function <code>::CrFwAppSmReset</code>).
 * This causes a transition to state RESET where the Application Reset Procedure
 * is executed.
 * This procedure is an adaptation point for the application (it is defined in
 * <code>CrFwAppResetProc.c</code>).
 *
 * Finally, the orderly shutdown of an application is performed by sending command
 * Shutdown to the Application State Machine (this is done through function
 * <code>::CrFwAppSmShutdown</code>).
 * This triggers a transition to state SHUTDOWN where the Application Shutdown Procedure
 * is executed.
 * This procedure is an adaptation point for the application (it is defined in
 * <code>CrFwAppShutdownProc.c</code>).
 *
 * Applications may define embedded state machines in the states
 * of the Application State Machine.
 * The embedded state machines are adaptation points for the framework.
 * They are defined in <code>CrFwAppSmUserPar.h</code>.
