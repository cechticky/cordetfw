/**

 * @ingroup crOpenIfGroup
 * Interface to the Application Shutdown Procedure.
 * The Application Shutdown Procedure is started by the Application
 * State Machine (see <code>CrFwAppSm.h</code>).
 * It executes while the state machine is in state SHUTDOWN.
 * This procedure is responsible for shutting down all
 * the application components and for performing any other shutdown action
 * for the application.
 * The Application Shutdown Procedure is entirely application-specific.
 * This header file declares a function to retrieve a pointer to the procedure
 * descriptor.
 * The implementation of this file provides an implementation of the procedure
 * and is therefore application-specific.
