 * @ingroup outMngGroup
 * Definition of the OutRegistry Component.
 *
 * An OutRegistry acts as a registry for out-going commands or reports (namely for
 * commands or reports which have been loaded into an OutManager).
 * The OutRegistry is responsible for:
 * - keeping track of an out-going command's or report's state
 * - storing the enable state of out-going commands or reports
 * - storing the link between the index of an out-going command or report and its
 *   service type and sub-type
 * .
 * The index of an out-going command or report is a positive integer in the range
 * from 0 to <code>::CR_FW_OUTREGISTRY_NSERV</code>-1.
 * <code>::CR_FW_OUTREGISTRY_NSERV</code> is the total number of out-going service
 * types and sub-types in an application.
 * The index of an out-going command or report uniquely identifies the command's
 * or report's type and sub-type.
 *
 * The set of out-going service types and sub-types supported by an application
 * is specified in <code>CrFwOutRegistryUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * The framework internally uses the index as a more efficient way of identifying
 * a pair [service type, service sub-type] for an out-going command or report.
 * The OutRegistry offers a function which allows the service type and service sub-type
 * associated to a certain index to be retrieved.
 *
 * The OutRegistry is a singleton component which is implemented as an extension
 * of the Base Component of <code>CrFwBaseCmp.h</code>.
 *
 * The OutRegistry maintains a list of the last N commands or reports to have been
 * loaded in an OutManager.
 * The OutRegistry maintains the state of each such command or report.
 * The command's or report's state in the OutRegistry can have one of the following values:
 * - PENDING: the command or report is waiting to be sent
 * - ABORTED: the command or report was aborted because it was disabled when it was loaded
 * - TERMINATED: the command or report has been passed to the OutStream
 * .
 * The value of N (the maximum number of items which can be tracked by the OutRegistry)
 * is fixed and is an initialization parameter.
 *
 * The OutRegistry uses the instance identifier of the OutComponent encapsulating
 * the out-going report or command as the key through which the out-going command or report
 * state is tracked.
 *
 * The OutRegistry stores the enable state of out-going commands and reports.
 * The enable state of out-going command and reports can be controlled at three levels:
 * - At the level of the service type (all commands or reports of a certain type are disabled)
 * - At the level of the service sub-type (all commands or reports matching a certain
 *   [type, sub-type] pair are disabled)
 * - At the level of the discriminant (all commands or reports matching a certain
 *   [type, sub-type, discriminant] triplet are enabled or disabled)
 * .
 * The enable state of a particular out-going command or report is derived from these three
 * enable levels by running the Enable State Determination Procedure shown in the
 * figure below.
 * The OutRegistry offers functions through which all three levels of enable state
 * can be controlled and through which the enable state of a specific out-going
 * command or report can be determined.
 * By default, the enable state for all kinds of reports or commands is set to:
 * "enabled".
 *
 * <b>Mode of Use of an OutRegistry Component</b>
 *
 * The configuration of the OutRegistry component is defined statically in
 * <code>CrFwOutRegistryUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * The OutRegistry component is a "final" component that does not normally need
 * to be extended.
 *
 * An OutRegistry component is created with function <code>::CrFwOutRegistryMake</code>.
 * After being created, the OutRegistry must be initialized and reset.
 * This is done with functions <code>::CrFwCmpInit</code> and <code>::CrFwCmpReset</code>.
 * Nominally, after being initialized and reset the OutRegistry State Machine should be
 * in state CONFIGURED (this can be checked by verifying that function <code>FwSmGetCurState</code>
 * returns CR_FW_BASE_STATE_CONFIGURED).
