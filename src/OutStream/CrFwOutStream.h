/**

 * @ingroup outMngGroup
 * Definition of the OutStream component.
 *
 * An application will normally instantiate one OutStream Component for
 * each report or command destination.
 * An OutStream is implemented by the OutStream State Machine (see figures below)
 * embedded within state CONFIGURED of a Base State Machine.
 *
 * This header file defines a function to create and access the OutStream attached to a
 * certain command or report destination.
 * This header file therefore also defines the interface to the OutStreamRegistry
 * component of the CORDET Framework.
 *
 * An application can instantiate several OutStream Components.
 * Each OutStream instance has an identifier which uniquely identifies it
 * within the set of OutStream Components.
 * This identifier is an integer in the range 0 to: <code>#CR_FW_NOF_OUTSTREAM</code>-1.
 *
 * <b>Mode of Use of an OutStream Component</b>
 *
 * The configuration of the OutStream components is defined statically in
 * <code>CrFwOutStreamUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * An OutStream component is created with function <code>::CrFwOutStreamMake</code>.
 * After being created, the OutStream must be initialized and reset.
 * This is done with functions <code>::CrFwCmpInit</code> and <code>::CrFwCmpReset</code>.
 * Nominally, after being initialized and reset the OutStream State Machine should be
 * in state CONFIGURED (this can be checked by verifying that function <code>FwSmGetCurState</code>
 * returns CR_FW_BASE_STATE_CONFIGURED).
 *
 * After it has been configured, an OutStream can process two transition commands:
 * - A Send command to send a packet (representing either a command or a report)
 *   to the middleware connection attached to the OutStream.
 *   This command is sent through function <code>::CrFwOutStreamSend</code>.
 * - A ConnectionAvailable command to signal the ability of the middleware to send
 *   a new packet to its destination. This command is sent with the
 *   the <code>::CrFwOutStreamConnectionAvail</code> function.
 * .
 * If at the time the Send command is received, the middleware is not ready to receive
 * the packet, the packet is stored in Packet Queue.
 * The next attempt to send it out will be made when command ConnectionAvailable is sent.
