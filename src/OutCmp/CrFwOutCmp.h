/**
 * @file
 * @ingroup outMngGroup
 * Definition of the OutComponent Component of the framework.
 *
 * An OutComponent encapsulates an out-going command or an out-going report.
 * The OutComponent is responsible for serializing the out-going command or report
 * to a packet and sending the packet to an OutStream for dispatching to its
 * destination.
 * The behaviour of an OutComponent is defined by the OutComponent State Machine
 * embedded in the CONFIGURED state of the Base State Machine and
 * by the Send Packet Procedure (see figures below).
 *
 * <b>Mode of Use of an OutComponent Component</b>
 *
 * Applications create OutComponents dynamically through calls to the factory
 * function <code>::CrFwOutFactoryMakeOutCmp</code>.
 * OutComponents thus returned are expected to be in state CREATED (if this
 * is not the case - perhaps because the OutComponent's configuration action
 * has failed to complete successfully - the OutComponent will remain permanently
 * pending and will never be sent to its destination).
 *
 * An OutComponent is used to encapsulate an out-going command or report of
 * a certain kind.
 * The "kind" of an out-going command or report is defined by the triplet:
 * [service type, service sub-type, discriminant].
 * OutComponents are adapted to a certain kind of out-going report or command
 * by modifying one or more of the following:
 * - The Enable Check Operation
 * - The Ready Check Operation
 * - The Repeat Check Operation
 * - The Update Action Operation
 * - The Serialize Operation
 * .
 * These operations are statically defined for each kind of OutComponent in
 * <code>CrFwOutFactoryUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * This header file defines default values for all configurable operations listed
 * above.
 * The default implementations for the Enable Check, Ready Check and Repeat Check will
 * often be suitable for many kinds of out-going reports or commands but
 * dedicated implementations of the Serialize and Update Action will probably have to
 * be provided for application-specific out-going reports or commands.
