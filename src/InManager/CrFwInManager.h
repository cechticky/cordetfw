 * Definition of the InManager component.
 *
 * The InManager component is responsible for maintaining a list of
 * pending InReports (see <code>CrFwInRep.h</code>) and InCommands (see <code>CrFwInCmd.h</code>)
 * and for repeatedly executing them until they are either aborted or terminated.
 *
 * The list of pending InReports or InCommands is called the Pending Command/Report List or PCRL.
 * The PCRL has a fixed size which is defined statically in <code>CrFwInManagerUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * The InManager is defined as an extension of the Base Component (see <code>CrFwBaseCmp.h</code>).
 * It uses the Execution Procedure of the Base Component to process the pending InReport and InCommands.
 * The InManager component processes the pending InReports or InCommands by sending them an Execute
 * command.
 * After each Execute command, the state of the pending item is reported to the InRegistry
 * (see <code>CrFwInRegistry.h</code>).
 * InReports or InCommands which have been aborted or have terminated are removed
 * from the PCRL and are returned to the InFactory.
 * The Execution Procedure of the InManager is shown in the figure below.
 *
 * <b>Mode of Use of an InManager Component</b>
 *
 * The configuration of the InManager components is defined statically in
 * <code>CrFwInManagerUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * An InManager component is created with function <code>::CrFwInManagerMake</code>.
 * After being created, the InManager must be initialized and reset.
 * This is done with functions <code>::CrFwCmpInit</code> and <code>::CrFwCmpReset</code>.
 * Nominally, after being initialized and reset the InManager State Machine should be
 * in state CONFIGURED (this can be checked by verifying that function <code>FwSmGetCurState</code>
 * returns CR_FW_BASE_STATE_CONFIGURED).
 *
 * Note that an application can have any number of InManagers.
 *
 * An InManager offers a Load operation (<code>::CrFwInManagerLoad</code>) through which
 * an InReport or InCommand can be added to the PCRL.
 * This operation is normally called by the InLoader (see <code>CrFwInLoader.h</code>).
 *
 * Note that there is no mechanism to “unload” a pending InReport or InCommand.
 * The InManager autonomously returns an InReport or InCommand to its factory when the
 * component has terminated or has been aborted.
 * InReports are considered to have been terminated after they are executed once.
 * InCommands are terminated if they are in state TERMINATED and they are aborted if
 * they are in state ABORTED.
 *
 * After an InManager has been configured, it can be executed by means of function
 * <code>FwSmExecute</code>.
 * Execution of an InManager causes its Execution Procedure (see figure below) to be
 * executed.
 *
 * When an InManager is reset or shutdown, its PCRL is reset (all pending InCommands and
 * InReports are cleared and returned to theirs factories).

/**
 * Load a new InReport or InCommand into the InManager.
 * The behaviour implemented by this function is shown in the activity diagram below.
 * If the PCRL is not full, the function identifies a free position in the PCRL where
 * to store the InReport/InCommand.
 * This function adds InReport/InCommand to the PCRL. The PCRL is flushed when the InManager
 * is executed (i.e. it is flushed by function <code>::InManagerExecAction</code>).
 * The algorithms to identify a free position in the PCRL and to process the PCRL
 * entries when the InManager is executed are optimized for a situation where multiple
 * load operations are performed before the InManager is executed.
 *
 * Additionally, these algorithms guarantee the following ordering constraint.
 * Let InReports/InCommands C1 to Cn be successfully loaded into an InManager through a sequence
 * of calls to function <code>::CrFwInManagerLoad</code> and assume that this sequence
 * of load operations is not interrupted by an execution of the InManager.
 * Under these conditions, when the InManager is executed next, the InReport/InCommand C1 to
 * Cn will be processed in the order in which they have been loaded.
 *
 * The implementation of function <code>::CrFwInManagerLoad</code> is based on the
 * internal variable <code>freePos</code>. This variable has the following
 * characteristics:
 * - it is initialized to point to the first entry in the PCRL;
 * - after the execution of the load function, <code>freePos</code> either points to the next
 * free position in the PCRL or is equal to the PCRL size if the PCRL is full;
 * - after execution of the InManager, it is re-initialized to point to the first position
 * in the PCRL.
