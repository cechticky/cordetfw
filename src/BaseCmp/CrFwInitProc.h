/**
 * @file
 * @ingroup baseCmpGroup
 * Component Initialization Procedure (CIP) for the Base Component.
 * The CIP is one of the procedures which implement the behaviour of the
 * Base Component (see <code>CrFwBaseCmp.h</code>).
 * The CIP is shown as an activity diagram in the left-hand side of the
 * figure below.
 *
 * The CIP (like the Base Component) is a singleton.
 * This header file gives access to the singleton instance of the CIP.
 * This header file also gives access to the functions which implement the
 * two actions of the CIP.
 * These actions represent adaptation points of the framework and they are
 * therefore made externally accessible so that derived component may override
 * them.
 *
 * All components derived from the Base Component need an own version of
 * the CIP.
 * They obtain it by extending the CIP instance defined in this file.
