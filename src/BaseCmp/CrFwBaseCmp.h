/**
 * @file
 * @ingroup baseCmpGroup
 * Definition of Base Component.
 * A Base Component implements the behaviour of the Base State Machine
 * (see figures below).
 *
 * All components used in the framework are derived from the Base Component
 * (i.e. all framework components are implemented by state machines which are
 * derived from the Base State Machine).
 * Hence, all framework components inherit the behaviour of the Base
 * State Machine.
 *
 * The Base State Machine is a singleton.
 * This header file defines the operation to create and access this singleton
 * instance.
 *
 * A Base State Machine responds to three transition commands: Init,
 * Reset and Shutdown.
 * This header file defines functions to send these three commands to a Base Component
 * or to one of its derived components.
 *
 * The Base State Machine uses three procedures, the
 * Component Initialization Procedure, the Component Reset Procedure,
 * and the Component Execution Procedure.
 * The first two procedures are defined in <code>CrFwInitProc.h</code> and
 * <code>CrFwResetProc</code>.
 * The third procedure is defined as a dummy in <code>CrFwExecProc.h</code>.
 *
 * The Base Component defines the Instance Identifier and Type Identifier
 * attributes.
 * The Type Identifier identifies the type of a component.
 * The Instance Identifier identifies an instance within a type.
 * This module defines the functions to access the type and instance identifier of
 * a Base Component or of a component derived from a Base Component.
