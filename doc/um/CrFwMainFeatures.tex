\begin{fw_itemize}
\item{} \textbf{Well-{}Defined Semantics}: clearly and unambiguously defined behaviour.
\item{} \textbf{Minimal Memory and CPU Requirements}: core module footprint of less than 20 kBytes and efficient implementation in C.
\item{} \textbf{Scalability}: code memory footprint independent of the number of commands and reports.
\item{} \textbf{High Reliability}: test suite with 100\% code, branch, and condition coverage.
\item{} \textbf{Formal Specification}: user requirements to formally specify the implementation.
\item{} \textbf{Requirement Traceability}: all requirements individually traced to their implementation and to verification evidence.
\item{} \textbf{Documented Code}: doxygen documentation for all the source code.
\item \textbf{Demo Applications}: complete applications demonstrating capabilities and mode of use.
