 * A service is defined in terms of the following characteristics:
 * - The service type identifier
 * - The service sub-type identifier
 * - The range of discriminant values for that service type and sub-type

/**
 * Definition of the range of out-going services supported by an application.
 * An application supports a number of service types and, for each service type, it supports
 * a number of sub-types.
 * Each sub-type may support a range of discriminant values.
 * Each line in this initializer describes one [service type, service sub-type] pair together
 * with a range of discriminant.
 * The elements in each line are as follows:
 * - The service type s
 * - The service sub-type b
 * - The lower bound l of the range of discriminant values
 * - The upper bound u of the range of discriminant values
 * - Four values used internally by the software which must be set to zero
 * .
 * If a [type,sub-type] pair does not support a discriminant, then l and u must be set to zero.
 *
 * The list of service descriptors must satisfy the following constraints:
 * - The number of lines must be the same as <code>#CR_FW_OUTREGISTRY_NSERV</code>.
 * - The service types must be listed in increasing order.
 * - The service sub-types within a service type must be listed in increasing order.
 * - The set of service type and sub-types must be consistent with the service types and
 *   sub-types declared in the <code>#CR_FW_OUTCMP_INIT_KIND_DESC</code> initializer.
 * - The lower bound l of a range of discriminant values must be smaller than or equal to the
 *   upper bound u
 * .
 * Compliance with the last four constraints is checked by
 * <code>::CrFwAuxOutRegistryConfigCheck</code>.
