 *
 * Default implementation of the Application Shutdown Procedure of <code>CrFwAppShutdownProc.h</code>.
 * The implementation of this procedure is one of the adaptation points of the
 * CORDET Framework.
 * This file provides a default implementation which is primarily intended to
 * support testing.
 * It is expected that applications will provide their own implementation.
 * Application will therefore normally replace this file with their own file
 * providing their application-specific implementation of the Application Shutdown Procedure.
 *
 * This implementation defines a dummy procedure as in the figure below.
