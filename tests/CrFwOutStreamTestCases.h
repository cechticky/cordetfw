/**
 * Test the initialization and packet queue (PQ) management of the OutStream.
 * The following actions are performed in this test:
 * - Attempt to instantiate an OutStream with an illegal identifier and check that the operation
 *   fails.
 * - Instantiate one OutStream twice and check that the same instance is returned on both
 *   occasions.
 * - Check that the OutStream is correctly configured.
 * - Initialize and configure the OutStream and bring its state machine to state CONFIGURED-READY
 * - Check that the OutStream sequence counters and PQ size are correct
 * - Configure the Packet Hand-Over Operation to return "hand-over failed", send a packet
 *   to the OutStream and check that the PQ state is correctly updated and that the
 *   OutStream goes to state BUFFERING.
 * - Send the same packet multiple times until the PQ is full and check that its state
 *   is as expected.
 * - Send one more packet and check that an error report is generated.
 * In all cases, the packet is configured to belong to the first group associated
 * to the OutStream.
